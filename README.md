# Ludifit
Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing project. Ludifit is an android app that gamifies your life in the sense that
it rewards you for doing regular everyday exercise ranging from running, cycling and walking around. This reward
system is in terms of XP and achievements like a real game but in regard to your exercise. Half of the group
didn't to their job so the app isn't complete.
